## 🔧 TECHNICAL DEBT & ISSUES

### Critical Issues
1. ❌ **useAuth hook missing** - `lib/hooks/useAuth.js` contains page component instead of hook
   - Needs: useAuth, useLogin, useRegister hooks
   - Blocks: Login, Register, Dashboard authentication

2. ⚠️ **Document deletion from Cloudinary** - TODO comment in backend code
   - Files deleted from DB but not from storage

3. ⚠️ **Backend API connectivity** - Some frontend calls may not be properly connected
   - Health metrics API integration
   - Appointments API integration

### Code Quality Issues
- ⚠️ Mock data in appointments (needs real API)
- ⚠️ Reminder model has syntax errors (missing brackets in some methods)
- ⚠️ Some components have unused imports or variables

### Architecture Issues
- ⚠️ Dual database models (lib/models and backend/src/models) - potential inconsistency
- ⚠️ API routes split between Next.js API routes and Express backend
- ⚠️ Authentication hooks structure needs reorganization
